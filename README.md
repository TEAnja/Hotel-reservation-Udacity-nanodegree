# Hotel-reservation-Udacity-nanodegree
In this project, we designed and implemented a Java hotel reservation application. The hotel reservation application allows customers to find and book a hotel room based on room availability. This project demonstrates our abilities to design classes using OOP, organize and process data with collections, and use common Java types.
